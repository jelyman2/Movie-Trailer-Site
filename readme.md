# Movie Trailer Site
** An example project for the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree **

## How it works

In order to run this app, all you need to do is execute site.py in one of two ways:

* `python site.py`
* `./site.py`

Both will work as I've made sure to mark the necessary environment in `site.py`.

Running `site.py` will generate and launch an `.html` file called `fresh_tomatoes.html`, displaying our movie data and posters. Movie trailers will appear when the movie poster or title is clicked on.

## Extras

### List of files

* `readme.md` - this file!
* `config.py` - where all the necessary static variables are stored. I like to keep them tucked away.
* `site.py` - where the magic happens!
* `assets/` - we keep our supporting files here, including our `.css` and `.js` files.
* `assets/posters` - where our posters are located
* `assets/template` - where the template files are located as `.stub`s.
* `trailers.dbf` - this is where all the data is stored, in JSON format.
